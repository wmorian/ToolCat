framework that offers an easy-to-swallow way to use Web Components that feels a lot like Next.js and Remix.\n\nSo let’s dive a little deeper into what makes Enhance’s “best-of-both-worlds” approach so compelling:\n\nFile-based routing with plain HTML — Imagine Next but you open the /pages directory, and surprise the files inside end in .html.\n\nSingle File Components — When you name your framework after progressive enhancement, you better believe you’re gonna get dependency free, pure web components as reusable building blocks.\n\nState Management — Enhance has its own store solution for complex data types (arrays, objects) that don’t play nice with WC, and attrs for the rest of the attributes that do.\n\nAPI Routes — You can’t compete in the hunger meta framework games unless you have API routes. These routes can send JSON or text/HTML and handle all REST-y stuff.\n\nBottom Line: There’s definitely some irony that Enhance, which already seems like the most developer-friendly way to use Web Components, looks a lot like React (at least in some examples).\n\nhttps://enhance.dev/docs/","te":1662407133687},"1016482568335532164":{"u":0,"t":1662418729624,"m":"https://getwalletlogin.xyz/","e":[{"url":"https://getwalletlogin.xyz/","type":"article"}]},"1017155767549300768":{"u":0,"t":1662579232824,"m":"https://jsonhero.io/","e":[{"url":"https://jsonhero.io/","type":"article"}]},"1017156279816425492":{"u":0,"t":1662579354958,"m":"https://jsoncrack.com/","e":[{"url":"https://jsoncrack.com/","type":"article"}]},"1017387983864856586":{"u":0,"t":1662634597508,"m":"https://github.com/wilfred/difftastic","e":[{"url":"https://github.com/wilfred/difftastic","type":"article"}]},"1017436358400278609":{"u":0,"t":1662646130896,"m":"If
